  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Event Horizon (the “Service”).
    By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Who can use the Service</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country) to use the Service.</p>

  <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for your account and any activity under it. Keep your login credentials and API keys private.
    If you believe your account has been compromised, notify us and rotate (delete and recreate) your API keys.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not abuse or disrupt the Service (including automated scraping, denial-of-service, or attempting to bypass security).</li>
    <li>Do not upload harmful content (malware) or attempt unauthorized access.</li>
    <li>Do not use the Service to violate applicable laws or the rights of others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Events and content</h2>
  <p>
    Event organizers are responsible for the accuracy of event information they publish.
    We may remove content that violates these Terms or applicable law.
  </p>

  <h2>5. API and developer access</h2>
  <p>
    The Service provides API access (OAuth2 and API keys). You are responsible for securely storing tokens,
    respecting rate limits, and using the API in compliance with these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Availability</h2>
  <p>
    We try to keep the Service available, but it may be interrupted for maintenance or due to factors outside our control.
    The Service is provided “as is” without warranties.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    You can stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms,
    or if we need to protect the Service or other users.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we’ll provide a reasonable notice.
    Continued use of the Service means you accept the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For questions about these Terms, contact us through the project’s official channels.
