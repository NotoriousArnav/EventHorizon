    This Privacy Policy explains how Event Horizon collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information:</strong> username and email address.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile information:</strong> optional fields you choose to provide (such as avatar or social links).</li>
    <li><strong>Event and registration data:</strong> events you create and registrations you submit (including answers to registration questions).</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> basic logs needed to operate and secure the Service (for example, error traces).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve the Service.</li>
    <li>Send operational emails (verification, registration updates, API key expiry notices).</li>
    <li>Prevent abuse, protect accounts, and enforce these policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with service providers (for example email delivery)
    only as needed to operate the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep data as long as needed to provide the Service and meet legal or security requirements.
    You can delete API keys at any time from your dashboard.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable measures to protect the Service. However, no online service can be guaranteed 100% secure.
    Keep your tokens and passwords safe.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For privacy questions, contact us through the project’s official channels.
